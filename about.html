            <p>Detailed History of the Golden Retriever
Origins
Early Breeding (19th Century)

The Golden Retriever was developed in the late 19th century in Scotland. The breed was created primarily by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks, later known as Lord Tweedmouth.

Foundation Stock

In 1868, Lord Tweedmouth acquired a yellow Wavy-coated Retriever named Nous from a local fisherman. This dog became the foundation of the breed.
To improve the breed’s hunting abilities, Nous was bred with a female Tweed Water Spaniel named Belle, which contributed to the breed’s intelligence and demeanor.
